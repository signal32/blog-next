## Background
The Speyside Line ( also known as the Strathspey Railway) was opened on 1 July 1863 between Dufftown and Nethy Bridge. It was extended to meet up with the Highland Railway at Boat of Garten on 1 August 1866, then known as the Inverness and Perth Junction Railway. The Speyside Line actually met the Highland line some 3 miles north of Boat of Garten, but the two lines ran parallel until reaching Boat, the physical junction being to the south of Boat of Garten station. The same year, 1866, saw the Speyside Line become part of the larger Great North of Scotland Railway (GNSR).

The railway served the numerous distilleries that operated in the Spey Valley, many of these distilleries having their own small tank engines, or ‘pugs’ as they were known.

The Speyside line closed to passengers on 18 October 1965, the same date as the closure of the Highland line between Aviemore and Forres. Grantown on Spey, which had previously been served by two separate stations, was now left without any rail connection. The railway closed for good in 1968.

In this project my aim is to recreate the line between Craigelachie and Boat of Garten as it was in the 1950’s. This will allow for a great variety of rolling stock and traction to be used. In addition the section between Craigelachie and Keith Junction will also be included in the route, although this was not part of the Speyside Line.

The line is single track with loops at most stations, the route also features challenging gradients and tight curves as it negotiates it’s way up the river. There are various options for varied gameplay. Passenger workings range from through trains to the infamous railbus which served the line in it’s latter years. Likewise there are many opportunities for freight workings with the whisky traffic, many of which are served by their own branch lines which will be modelled.
