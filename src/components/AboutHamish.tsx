                <p>I am Hamish, a software engineer and technologist, floating around on the British canals. From developing complex web apps to building detailed rail simulations, I enjoy creating all sorts of things. Although many of these never see the light of day, my more polished projects can be found here.</p>
                <p>Away from the desk I am a keen photographer and publish some of my favourite shots here on this site.</p>

                <p>If you would like to get in touch with me for any reason, please <span className={emailText.hidden ? 'cursor-pointer' : ''} onClick={revealEmail}>{emailText.text}</span> and I happy to hear from you.</p>
                <p>You can also find me on <a href='https://github.com/signal32'>Github</a> and <a>Instagram</a></p>
